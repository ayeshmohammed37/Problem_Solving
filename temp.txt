path with n consecutive cells
each cell can be empty or contains throns or a coin
in one move you can move one or two cells, provided that the destination cell does not contain thorns
If you move to the cell with a coin, you pick it up
collect as many coins as possible.
find maximum number of coins you can collect

-------------------
input:
    t (1 <= t <= 1000) number of test cases
        for each test case:
            n (1 <= n <= 50) --the length of the path
            string of n chars,  '.' empty cell, '@' coin, '*' throns
output:
    for each test case 
        print maximum number of coins you can collect.

-----------------------

initializ t number of test cases:

for i in 1 to t
    initialize n the length of the path
    initialize path 

    initialize coins, throns
    for i in 0 to n-1 move i one step
        if current cell is coin
            add one to coins
            thrones = 0
        else if current cell is thrones
            add one to thrones
        if (thrones > 1)
            break loop
    print coins
